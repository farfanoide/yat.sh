#= DESCRIPTION: Basic tmux global session

# Create a new session and name the first window 'General'
# This is required as it actually creates the new session
new_session -n 'General'

# Send some command down to our new window called 'General'
send_line 'General' 'ls'

# Let's create yet another window
new_window -n 'Music'
send_line 'Music' 'cd ~/Music'

# What about splitting windows into panes?
hsplit'Downloads'

# Now we need to target that panel specifically, we can do it by appending its
# index to the window name. Pane and window indexes usually range from 0 to n
# but you can tune it by setting some options on your tmux.conf. If you want
# your session files to be truly portable there are some helpers that can make
# it easyer like `get_pane_base_index` and `get_window_base_index`
paneindex=$(get_pane_base_index)
send_line "Downloads.$(($paneindex + 1))" 'cd ~/Downloads ; ls'
